Title: Lensing covariance and 'bad' integrals
Date: 2017-01-21
Category: Research
Summary: Sometimes integrals diverge because of physics, or, how to properly compute covariance matrices in cosmology.

If the galaxy and matter fields are Gaussian, then the projected two-point covariance is:
$$Cov(r_i,r_j) = A_W \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{dk\, k}{2 \pi} J_0(k r_i) J_0(k r_j) \left(P(k) + \frac{1}{n_g}\right)^2$$
