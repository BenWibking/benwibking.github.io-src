abstract = "The combination of galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) with galaxy clustering is one of the most promising routes to determining the amplitude of matter clustering at low redshifts. We show that extending clustering+GGL analyses from the linear regime down to $\\sim 0.5 \\, h^{-1}$ Mpc scales increases their constraining power considerably, even after marginalizing over a flexible model of non-linear galaxy bias. Using a grid of cosmological N-body simulations, we construct a Taylor-expansion emulator that predicts the galaxy autocorrelation $\\xi\\_{gg}$ and galaxy-matter cross-correlation $\\xi\\_{gm}$ as a function of $\\sigma_8$, $\\Omega_m$, and halo occupation distribution (HOD) parameters, which are allowed to vary with large scale environment to represent possible effects of galaxy assembly bias. We present forecasts for a fiducial case that corresponds to BOSS LOWZ galaxy clustering and SDSS-depth weak lensing (effective source density $\\sim 0.3$ arcmin$^{-2}$). Using tangential shear and projected correlation function measurements over 0.5 ≤ $r_p$ ≤ 30 $h^{-1}$ Mpc yields a 2% constraint on the parameter combination $\\sigma_8 \\Omega_m^{0.6}$, a factor of two better than a constraint that excludes non-linear scales ($r_p$ > 2 $h^{-1}$ Mpc, 4 $h^{-1}$ Mpc for $\\gamma_t$, $w_p$). Much of this improvement comes from the non-linear clustering information, which breaks degeneracies among HOD parameters. Increasing the effective source density to 3 arcmin$^{-2}$ sharpens the constraint on $\\sigma_8 \\Omega_m^{0.6}$ by a further factor of two. With robust modeling into the non-linear regime, low-redshift measurements of matter clustering at the 1-percent level with clustering+GGL alone are well within reach of current data sets such as those provided by the Dark Energy Survey."
