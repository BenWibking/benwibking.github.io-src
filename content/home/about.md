# About Me

I am currently working with Prof. Mark Krumholz on understanding the distribution of chemical elements produced by massive stars in the Milky Way and analogue galaxies via constrained-transport magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, as well as implementing methods for radiation transport suitable for exascale computing architectures.  My previous work in cosmology used simulations of structure formation to infer cosmological parameters from galaxy-shear cross-correlations on nonperturbative scales using galaxies from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey.
