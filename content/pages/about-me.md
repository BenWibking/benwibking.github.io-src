Title: About me
Summary: I'm a grad student in astronomy at Ohio State University.

I'm a grad student in astronomy at Ohio State University. I study models of galaxy bias applicable to cosmological parameter inference with weak lensing and galaxy clustering. I also study the radiation hydrodynamics of the interstellar medium, in particular the dynamical effects of radiation on dust.
